# DEVELOPMENT DISCONTINUED, similar available at [here](https://github.com/Octal450/MD-11)


==============

Thanks to Skyop (Ryan Miller) the original DC-10-30ER developer, Jabberwocky (Peter Brendt), Josh Davidson (Octal450), J-Maverick16, Israel Hernandez (IAHM-COL), Cain, Hooray, Philosopher, 5H1N0B1, Syd Adams, and others for their significant contributions!

Although the great age of Tri-Jet passenger airliners appears to have passed for now (although FEDEX was flying DC-10s converted to MD-10s in regular cargo service and the U.S. Air Force has recently upgraded its KC-10A to the KC-10 Extender, which is projected to see service through 2036, according to Wikipedia) there are a dedicated group of Tri-Jet enthusiasts in the flight simulation community that want to see these aircraft remain a regular participant in the skies of FlightGear.  From that love of this airplane, the MD-10 conversion project was born initially by Skyboat, but he was soon joined by others who share the same passion for the plane, first by JWocky, then most recently and significantly by it0uchpods, a talented young aircraft developer who is now working in collaboration with SkyBoat.  Another recent contributer is J-Maverick16 who is helping with the interior of the flightdeck.

From Wikipedia:

	"The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions."

Thanks to Phil Efstahiou for the great "Orbis Flying Eye Hospital" and the "Retirement Equatorial Tour" livery!

Thanks to Israel Hernandez (IAHM-COL) for the wonderful DC-10 35th Anniversary "Roll-Out" livery, the United Airlines livery and the new June 2016 "Orbis Flying Eye Hospital Livery"!
